# Research interests

I combine multi-scale models for Arctic sea ice dynamics and fracture with Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification to forecast Arctic sea ice.

My current research interests are:
- Implementing multi-scale methods to simulate and forecast the Arctic sea ice
- Developing machine learning methods to accelerate expensive physical models 
- Using optimal experimental design to allocate limited resources for Arctic monitoring
- Developing Bayesian computational algorithms that efficiently characterize probability distributions even when the target density is computationally expensive
