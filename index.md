I am interested in computational science and engineering, specializing in Bayesian statistics, probability, numerical methods, optimization, and machine learning. 

My current research uses numerical and mathematical tools to understand and predict cryospheric dynamics. My three primary research thrusts are:
1. Developing multi-scale cryospheric models exploring sea ice and glacier mechanics.
2. Deriving Bayesian computational algorithms for inference and prediction under uncertainty.
3. Applying machine learning tools to develop computationally efficient surrogates for cryospheric models.

I contribute to open-source software that makes state-of-the-art tools available to the scientific community. I am proficient in C/C++, Python, MATLAB and programming tools such as git and cmake.
